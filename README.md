## Group Project Abstract

### Intro
***Distant Reading*** is a form of literary analysis performed in a computer program by aggregating and analyzing text; the program identifies literary genres and envisions plots by mining through each word and phrase. ***Close reading*** is done with first hand reading and analysis of text, which has led to great insights and advancements in literature from unique styles and themes derived from texts.

### Research Question
Distant Reading is a relatively new term that may cause many to ask exactly what it is and why it's important. My group and I worked collaboratively, researching several articles which provide a brief overview, to answer our questions: 
* **What is this *new* concept?** 
* **How does it compare with the method of Close Reading?** 
* **What can we learn from it?**
Based on the readings on distant learning and the digital humanities, the concepts, as well as methods for testing Distant Reading are further explored. 

### Methods/Materials
Machine learning is used to analyze text and identify genres and styles. Distant reading is also tested by using it to categorize and formulate topics on a corpus of ekphrasis poems - which is recognized for its figurative references of visual arts and metaphors, words that differ from their literal meaning and manner of speech. 

### Findings
Distant learning quickly analyzes a great amount of text in the manner of minutes, and is able to discern between genres and styles in the literature. However, when faced with the corpus of poems, Distant Reading gives misinterpretations of the text. 

### Dr. Nan Z Da
Dr. Nan Z Da, explains the literary complexity present with current computational methods and the tradeoff between precision and efficiency. Further research in computational methods are needed to address the issues identified by the authors, as there is still no computationally effective way to analyze large amounts of text without sacrificing the important nuances in literature.

### Discussion
By examining the issues, trade offs, and benefits of Distant reading, the readings also identify its shortcomings. Our group collectively feel that distant reading is a very beneficial tool, but should not be the sole instrument in analyzing data. Our group worked well together, splitting up the readings, taking notes and informing each other of key points. We reached our own conclusions on the materials read while we learned about the topic, methods used, and revealed the findings. After which, we created a presentation to present our topic and findings to our peers, engaging them to share their own views.
